# Cache-Simulation
CDA3101 Intro to Computer Organization - Project 3

Implemented three cache designs (fully associative, direct mapped, set associative) with two replacement policies (LRU, FIFO).
Place trace files into the same folder as the source code.
Sample simulation tests have been written for the "gcc.trace" file in main and will print the results of each test to the terminal.
