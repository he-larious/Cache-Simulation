# Cache-Simulation
Implemented three cache designs (fully associative, direct mapped, set associative) with two replacement policies (LRU, FIFO).
Compile with C++ gcc compiler to guarantee success.
Sample simulation tests have been written in main and will print the results of each test to the terminal.
